A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. § § 6501-06 and 16 C.F.R. § § 312.1-312.12, Eveness does not permit children under 13 years of age to use the Eveness Platform without their parent's or guardian's express consent and approval.

If you are under 18 years of age, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not understand. Children under 13 years of age should get your parent's or legal guardian's permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to Eveness or to anyone else on the Internet.
I. Information Received by Eveness
When you make use of the Eveness Platform, we may collect or receive, automatically or by your choice, certain information about you to provide, maintain, and improve our services. Only authorized Eveness staff have access to your personal information in its entirety. Other staff may have access to portions of this information if it pertains to their job duties. The types of information we may collect are as follows.
A. Personal Information. Eveness may collect a variety of personal information, including but not limited to:
Contact Information such as your name, address, phone number, and email address.
Demographic Information, such as your age, gender, race, and location.
Biometric Data, or physical characteristics like your facial structure, eye color and shape, height, weight, and body type. 
Payment and Billing Information, including bank name, payment method, billing name, address, and Invoice subtotals (collectively, “Financial Information”).
[Referrals. We may allow Users to refer third parties interested in becoming Users of the Eveness Platform to the Eveness Platform. When you refer a third party to our Eveness Platform, we may collect and store information both about the referring User and about the third party being referred. Such information may include name, email address, and phone number.]
You voluntarily provide this information by allowing the Platform to gather data and information relating to the Recommendations in conjunction with your account registration, fill out Surveys (as that term is defined in the Eveness Terms of Use) through our Eveness Platform, receive a Facial Scan (as that term is defined in the Eveness Terms of Use) through our Eveness Platform, communicate with our Eveness Platform’s chatbot, sign up for newsletters, promotional messages, or other marketing and advertising, or otherwise access the Eveness Platform. 
B. Anonymous or Aggregated Data. Eveness collects and stores certain data about the use of the Eveness Platform on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. Eveness does not link this information to anything personally identifiable to you.

C. Technical Information and Advertising Technologies. Eveness may collect and store information about you and your device(s) automatically when you access or use the Eveness Platform. This information may include your IP address, your device type, information relating to your usage of the Application, and user tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, or other similar technologies.
1. IP Address. When you visit and interact with the Eveness Platform, Eveness and/or third parties with whom Eveness has contracted to provide services to Eveness may collect your Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”), which is a number that is automatically assigned to the device that you are using to access the Application by your Internet Service Provider. This number is identified and logged automatically whenever you visit the Application, along with the date(s) and time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use IP Addresses to monitor the regions from which Users navigate the Application, for fraud prevention purposes, and for interest-based advertising.
2. Site Usage Information. We may collect information such as the webpage you visited immediately before or after you visited our Application’s landing page website, or the pages or features you visited on our Application. We collect this information to understand how Users interact with the Application and to improve each User’s experience.
3. Cookies. Like many apps, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Eveness uses cookies to provide and improve services through the Eveness Platform. We may utilize persistent cookies that only Eveness can read and use, or session ID cookies that are deleted from your hard drive when you log off from the Application and Eveness Platform and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Eveness Platform may also place or read cookies on your browser and we may use Flash cookies (or local shared objects) to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.
How We Use Persistent Cookies. We may use persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Eveness Platform, to assist in processing items in your shopping cart, to hold session information, and to track user preferences in order to tailor advertisements and content on the Eveness Platform to your preferences and interests. 
How We Use Session ID Cookies. We may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Eveness Platform, to better understand how you interact with the Eveness Platform, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Eveness Platform, and to identify visited areas of the Eveness Platform. 
How to Manage Cookies. When you access the Eveness Platform, you may opt to stop accepting cookies or to be prompted before accepting a cookie from the Eveness Platform or its third party advertisers. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Eveness Platform. 
4. Web Beacons. We may also use “web beacons,” also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with the Eveness Platform to, among other things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, to measure the performance of the Application, to determine the success of marketing campaigns, and to compile aggregate statistics about Application usage and response rates. This information is collected anonymously and in a manner that does not personally identify you. Web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages or in an email.
5. Log File Information. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. When you use our Eveness Platform, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Eveness Platform, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Eveness Platform.
6. Metadata. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when, and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users may add or have Metadata added to their User Content, including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments, or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using another's APIs, then your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature).
II. Eveness’s Use of Personal Information
Two things drive Eveness’s decisions regarding the use of information collected from Users: 1) providing, tailoring, and improving User experience by offering personalized services, content, and advertising; and 2) market research. As such, Eveness utilizes User personal information for the following general purposes:
to provide, improve, and maintain services, Recommendations, customer support, the Eveness Algorithm, and the Eveness Platform;
for billing, identification and authentication, and fraud prevention;
for internal market research and trend forecasting;
for troubleshooting problems, and detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;
for communications with Users, such as notifications on the status of incoming or outgoing service requests, Recommendations, or to provide, personalize, and improve advertising and marketing campaigns, including promotional messages, third party advertising, surveys, sweepstakes, or other promotional activities or events;
in order to receive support and/or services from third parties that provide Eveness with services used to generate Recommendations, including but not limited to OpenAI, Meta, and Google Cloud AI/ML (collectively, “Third Parties”);
as required to maintain legal and regulatory compliance;
to enforce our Terms of Use; and
as otherwise set forth in the Privacy Policy.
Although we encourage Third Parties receiving your information to utilize privacy restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this policy, Eveness cannot guarantee Third Party privacy policies will be so restrictive and is not responsible for any issues that may arise regarding the privacy policies of any of its Associates. By using the Eveness Platform, you do hereby agree to hold Eveness harmless from any claims and/or damages that may arise from the actions of any of its affiliates and/or advertisers.
Eveness may use cookies and other technologies and personal information to place information and/or advertisements where we believe interested parties will see them.
Eveness may analyze personal information and web navigational data based on your interests and may use the analysis from this information in a way that does not reveal a User’s personal information (“Market Research”) in order to:
Market the Eveness Platform;
Develop and maintain the Eveness Algorithm;
Improve the likelihood of a sale of advertised products to a group of Users;
Increase the likelihood that a group's experience with the Eveness Platform is relevant to its interests as a whole.
Eveness uses data at the individual level to market products and services to Users who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from our Market Research.
Eveness may use your phone number, if provided, to call, text, or email you in order to provide services or features associated with the Eveness Platform. 
We use Financial Information solely as authorized by you in accordance with the Eveness Platform.
III. Eveness’s Information Retention Policy
[How long does Eveness keep personal identifiable info.?] Unless we are required to retain User personal information by law, we will have no obligation to retain information submitted by Users for a period of more than two (2) years from the date we become aware that a User has ceased using the Eveness Platform. It is each User’s responsibility to contact us upon ceasing using the Eveness Platform. We may retain User information that is not personally identifiable indefinitely, unless we are required to delete it by law, for the purposes of backups, archiving, fraud and abuse prevention, analytics, or for other reasons which we reasonably believe to be necessary for the continued operation and maintenance of the Eveness Platform. If required by law, we will delete User information by erasing it from our database. We will also respond to User requests to delete or correct account or personal information, which you can do by terminating your account or contacting Eveness at [contact]. Additionally, any direct communications from you to our support email or employees will be retained for a lawful period pursuant to our corporate retention policy. (See Section VII for how Eveness’s third party vendors may use and retain personal information.)  
IV. With Whom Does Eveness Share Information?
Eveness will not sell, share, disclose, transfer, give, or exchange any User personal information collected through the Eveness Platform to a non-Associate third party without User consent, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.
Eveness may disclose User Financial Information to its Payment Service Provider (the “PSP”), currently Stripe, for the processing of payments of Service Agreements (as that term is defined in the Eveness Terms of Use).
Eveness reserves the right to disclose User personal information from both private and public areas of this website, at our discretion, if: (1) disclosure is required by law or we have a good faith belief that disclosure is required by law; (2) we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of Users, the general public, or Eveness; or (3) to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.
Finally, Eveness reserves the right to transfer, sell and/or distribute all information collected through the Eveness Platform to an affiliate, subsidiary, or third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets or stock. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the new entity follows this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, as and to the extent required by applicable law.
V. How does Eveness Protect User Information? 
Security of User information is very important to Eveness. We use end-to-end encryption and a variety of other reasonable and appropriate security measures within the Eveness Platform and request similar measures on any third-party servers to help protect the integrity and security of personal information that we collect and maintain. However, online activity and electronic information is never fully secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Eveness Platform, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
Please also recognize that protecting your information is your responsibility as well as ours. Each User is urged to take available precautions to protect their personal information before disclosing it online. Such precautions include regularly changing your passwords, using a secure browser, not disclosing your personal information to anyone unaffiliated with Eveness or Eveness’s Agents, and immediately contacting us in the event you suspect your account has been accessed without authorization or is otherwise no longer secure.
VI. How Can Users Edit Their Information?
Eveness believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and edit your personal information. To update your personal information, select the Account tab at the top of the user interface. Your information can only be updated after you have logged in to your account in order to prevent your information from being accessible by third parties. From your Account page, you can view, update and correct your account information. You may edit your account information at any time—all you need is your username and password.
VII. Agents, Consultants, and Related Third Party Sites
Eveness uses third party vendors and Third Parties to perform certain operations and business-related functions. Examples of such functions include but are not limited to, data storage services, database maintenance services, video services, Recommendations, and payment processing. When Eveness employs such Outside Services to perform services on its behalf, Eveness will only provide them with such personal information as they need to perform their specific function. Unless expressly stated otherwise, each third-party vendor is required to keep such information confidential and not to use such information for any purpose other than providing services to Eveness. Unless expressly stated otherwise, such third-party vendors will be required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. However, some of the Third Parties that provide operational services have their own terms of service and privacy policies. While the privacy and security of confidential information is important to us, the handling, storage, security, and use of this information will be governed by the policies of each respective Third Party service.  If you do not wish to rely on the policies of such Third Parties, you should not use our Platform. We urge you to review the Terms of Use and Privacy policies of such Third Parties here: https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/, https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai/, https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/genai_privacy_google_cloud_202308.pdf. 
Some functionality of the Eveness Platform may be provided by third parties or link to third-party websites that are not controlled by Eveness. Eveness is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Users are advised to consult the privacy practices of such third parties before providing any personal information to such third parties or through such third-party websites.
VIII. Notification of changes
Eveness’s security and Privacy Policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy might change as Eveness updates and expands the Application and Eveness Platform. Eveness will endeavor to notify you of these changes by email, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. Eveness also encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. 
IX. California Residents
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. Many of its provisions to do not yet apply to Eveness but may in the future.  Learn more about the CCPA here. [insert link] 
X. International Users
Eveness is based in the United States. Accordingly, regardless of where you access our Eveness Platform or make use of the services provided through the Eveness Platform, the information we collect as part of that use will be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the United States. Any information we collect will be stored in accordance with United States privacy laws, regulations, and standards. These laws, regulations, and standards may not be the same your country of residence. You are hereby advised that by making use of the Eveness Platform, you consent to our collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information to and in the United States, and that we are not responsible for any User misunderstandings resulting from discrepancies between United States privacy laws, regulations, or standards, and those in your country of residence. Any User located outside of the United States who chooses to use the Eveness Platform is responsible for ensuring that such information conforms to all local data protection laws. 
XI. Safety Tips

The safety of our Users is very important to us. There are steps that each User should follow when using the Eveness Platform, or when receiving Advising services as arranged through Eveness. Please take a few minutes to read these tips.
Keep Your Personal Information Private
Be careful about sharing personal information, such as your full name, phone number, email, address and location. 
Note: Eveness will never send you an email asking for your username and password information. Any such communication should be reported immediately.
Spam/Scammers

All Users may be required to register with the PSP (currently, Stripe), agree to Terms of Use of the PSP (“PSP Terms”) and go through a vetting process, if any, at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Use between Users and the PSP retained by Eveness are available here (the “PSP Agreement”).

16. Dispute Resolution
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS WAIVER; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH EVENESS, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  All claims, controversies, and disputes in connection with these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof or the use of the Eveness Platform provided by Eveness that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms set forth below (the “Arbitration Agreement”), except that you and Eveness are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Eveness, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized Users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these Terms of Use.
Arbitration Rules.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules conflict with these Terms of Use (“Arbitration Rules”).  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand U.S. dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is ten thousand U.S. dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration.  If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
Arbitration Process.  A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG0
04175 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=
ADRSTG015822).  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Arbitration Location. Unless you and Eveness otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California.
Authority of the Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Eveness, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and these Terms of Use.  The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.  The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Eveness.
Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. 
Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND EVENESS HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and Eveness in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND EVENESS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms of Use, in the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead all claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in Los Angeles County, California.
Confidentiality.  No part of the procedures shall be open to the public or the media.  All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
Small Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Eveness may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Courts.  In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Los Angeles County, California, for such purpose.
Survival.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Eveness.
Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Eveness changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject any such change by providing Eveness written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Eveness Inc., Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 15446 Brookhurst Street, Westminster, California 92683, or by email from the email address associated with your Account to: hello@Eveness.com, within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last update" date above.  In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section.  By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Eveness in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).
FORUM AND VENUE.
You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.  You and Eveness agree that the jurisdiction and venue of these courts is exclusive.
17. Governing Law
Any dispute between you and Eveness will be governed by these Terms of Use and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Eveness controls and operates the Eveness Platform from its principal place of business in the United States of America, and the Eveness Platform is hosted in the United States.  If you are a User visiting the United States from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Eveness Platform, which is governed by U.S. law, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.
18. No Agency
No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms of Use.
19. General Provisions
Failure by Eveness to enforce any provision(s) of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Eveness with respect to its subject matter. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will be enforced to the fullest extent possible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use may not be assigned or transferred by you without our prior written approval. We may assign or transfer these Terms of Use without your consent, including but not limited to assignments: (i) to a parent or subsidiary, (ii) to an acquirer of assets, or (iii) to any other successor or acquirer. Any assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void. These Terms of Use will inure to the benefit of Eveness, its successors and assignees.
I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING TERMS OF USE AND AGREE THAT MY USE OF THE ALGORITHM AND EVENESS PLATFORM IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.
